# turnip-ticker

A Discord bot tracking turnip prices in Animal Crossing New Horizons.

When I got tired of being an `Aggressive Stalkholder` toward my friends in our Discord server, I created a bot to do that work for me.

This bot relies on [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome) and its fantastic [tutorial](https://discordjs.guide/), as well as Google Sheets.

To use, rename `example.config.json` to `config.json` and insert your bot's token.
